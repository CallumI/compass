# Compass

A web application to point to places and show their distance. For use with travelling so should work offline

Works best with with:
1. Javascript enabled
2. A smartphone shaped device (portrait)
3. Location services (GPS etc)
4. A `javascript:` URL hack to input new places... (place input view is TODO).
